# Superstore-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
This project involves analyzing the Superstore sales dataset to track sales performance across products, regions, and months, with cleaned and prepared data used to build an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualizing trends, comparing categories and regions, and enabling dynamic filtering for actionable insights.
During this project, I worked with the Superstore sales dataset to analyze sales performance and provide actionable insights. I started by cleaning the dataset, which involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring that key columns such as Order Date, Sales, Profit, and Quantity had correct data types. In addition, I added new columns to enhance analysis, including a Month-Year column for time-based trends and a Profit Margin column to evaluate profitability across products and regions.

Once the data was prepared, I performed descriptive analysis to uncover patterns in sales distribution across regions, categories, and sub-categories, as well as monthly and yearly trends. To make the insights interactive and easy to explore, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard, which included a line chart showing sales trends over months, a bar chart comparing sales by region, a donut chart highlighting sales contribution by category, and slicers for filtering by region or category.

This dashboard allowed users to analyze sales performance at multiple levels, identify high-performing regions and categories, and monitor trends over time efficiently. The project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis skills, including cleaning and transforming data, creating derived columns, visualizing data, and delivering actionable insights through Power BI.
